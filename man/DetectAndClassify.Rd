\arguments{
\item{input}{Either full path to directory containing .wav files or a list with file name as first element and .wav as second element}

\item{feature.df}{Dataframe of features from labeled sound files; first column must be class labels}

\item{tune}{Logical; if want to use 'tune' function for SVM; NOTE: for large datasets adds significant computing time}

\item{target.signal}{Labeled signal of interest from training data (feature.df)}

\item{min.freq}{Minimum frequency (Hz) of signal of interest}

\item{max.freq}{Maximum frequency (Hz) of signal of interest}

\item{n.windows}{Number of time windows to calculate for MFCCs}

\item{num.cep}{Number of cepstra coefficients to calculate for MFCCs}

\item{pattern.split}{Pattern to find and remove to create file name; currently set to ".wav"}

\item{probability.thresh.svm}{Probability threshold (provided by machine learning algorithm) to be considered as target signal}

\item{output.dir}{Specified output directory; set to current working directory}
