Description: The field of bioacoustics is inherently multidisciplinary and relies on computer scientists, engineers, and ecologists. This package is directed towards ecologists who are interested in incorporating bioacoustics into their research, but may not have the skills or training.The goal for the creation of this package was to make commonly used signal processing techniques and various machine learning algorithms readily available for anyone interested in using bioacoustics in their research.
